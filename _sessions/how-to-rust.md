    bio: I'm a software engineer with 10+ years experience in the automotive industry. Open source has been my passion since one of my 3rd year of faculty assistants has handed me a full set of 7 CDs with Debian GNU/LInux 3.0 Woody distribution. My background covers work with portable RTOS-es, C, Linux, GNU Make, shell, Perl, Python in automotive and security domains. I have recently started learning Rust in my spare time and I am impatiently waiting to be able to use Rust as part of my job.

In industries with long production pipelines and hard real-time requirements, such as automotive, C is "the" lingua franca to the point some standards, such as AUTOSAR, are defined in terms of C interfaces.

Rust, with its memory safety guarantees, ownership concepts, 0-cost abstractions and strong type system represents an excellent match for the industry and its specific requirements. Still, there are several hurdles to cross, before even considering Rust as an alternative to C.

This talk will highlight some of the hurdles the author identified, and possible practical solutions for them. It is also an open invitation to the Rust community to help with other ideas, so the autonomous cars of the future are less likely to kill us.
