The RIOT operating system, developed in C since around 2010 by an experienced community, provides a solid and efficient platform for modern embedded development (including support for threading), state-of-the-art networking over various transports (from Ethernet and Bluetooth to LoRa and 6LoWPAN), and is supported on a plethora of devices.
